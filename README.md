# Advent of Code 2021
[Advend of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other.

In the following table you can find my submissions.
